# 👋 Hi, I'm Elói Ramos — AI/Context Engineer & Venture Studio Founder

I design and build **multi-agent AI systems**, **spec-driven engineering pipelines**, and **offline-first SaaS architectures** with a strong emphasis on **compliance, transparency, and engineering autonomy**.

I lead a **deep-tech venture studio in stealth**, focused on incubating AI-native products engineered for sensitive, high-trust environments.  
I operate end-to-end across architecture, engineering, technical governance, and LLM-based orchestration.

## 🧭 What I Do

- Design **spec-first engineering pipelines** for multi-agent systems  
- Architect **local-first and offline-capable applications** with deterministic AI components  
- Build **context-aware toolchains** for research, code generation, and auditability  
- Develop **AI Act–aligned compliance workflows** for early-stage products  
- Lead **concept-to-MVP product incubation** inside a multi-project venture studio  
- Mentor agentic collaborators inside advanced multi-model ecosystems  

My work bridges **AI engineering**, **systems architecture**, and **founder-level strategy**, ensuring every deliverable is auditable, reproducible, and spec-governed.

# 🧠 Engineering Philosophy  
### Five Pillars That Guide My Work

### 1. **Spec-First, Code-Second**  
Every system begins with structure, constraints, and traceability.

### 2. **Local-First for Trust**  
Data belongs to users — offline-first is a strategic advantage.

### 3. **Auditable AI Is Good AI**  
Reproducibility and deterministic behavior matter deeply.

### 4. **Multi-Agent Systems Require Harmony**  
Agents must share context, cooperate, and follow unified governance.

### 5. **Compliance as a Feature**  
Regulatory alignment from day one creates defensibility and long-term scale.

# 🧩 Current Work (Stealth Mode)

I architect a portfolio of AI-driven products focused on:

- multi-agent orchestration  
- on-device AI pipelines  
- local-first SaaS  
- risk classification & compliance  
- engineering autonomy  
- spec-driven development  

Details, names, and architectures remain private until public launch.

## 📱 Current Project — Mobile App (Codename: Solstice) · MVP Phase

I’m currently leading the engineering and architectural development of a new **offline-first mobile application** designed for structured personal productivity and intelligent note workflows.

The MVP includes:

- A fully **local-first processing pipeline** (no cloud, no analytics, no external data sharing)  
- Intelligent text assistance running **on-device**, ensuring complete user privacy  
- A minimal, distraction-free writing environment  
- Smart organization for structuring thoughts, study materials, and personal notes  
- Context-aware suggestions to reduce cognitive load  
- A compliance-informed design approach aligned with consumer-grade privacy expectations  

The project follows a **privacy-first philosophy**, avoiding server dependencies and minimizing attack surface.  
More details will be shared publicly after the MVP launch.
