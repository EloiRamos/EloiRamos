# 👋 Hi, I'm Elói Ramos — AI/Context Engineer & Founder

I build **multi-agent AI systems**, **spec-driven engineering workflows**, and **offline-first SaaS architectures** designed for high-trust environments where privacy, reliability, and auditability are essential.

I run a deep-tech venture studio (currently in stealth) focused on orchestrating and scaling products that combine **local-first AI**, **deterministic pipelines**, and **rigorous specification governance**.  
My work sits at the intersection of **AI engineering**, **systems design**, and **product strategy** — ensuring every deliverable is **traceable, reproducible, and compliant by default**.

## 🧭 What I Do

- Engineer **spec-first** multi-agent systems and orchestration pipelines  
- Build **local/on-device** AI workflows for privacy-critical use cases  
- Design **offline-first architectures** with deterministic behavior  
- Govern full product lifecycles using **technical specifications** and audit-ready documentation  
- Architect AI Act–aligned compliance frameworks  
- Lead end-to-end venture incubation: research → architecture → MVP  
- Mentor AI collaborators inside heterogeneous multi-model ecosystems

## 🔧 Technical Focus Areas

### Core Domains
- Multi-Agent AI Orchestration  
- Context Engineering  
- Local-First / Offline-Only Architectures  
- Safety-Aware & Compliance-Centric AI  
- Specification Governance (OpenSpec / TechDocs)  
- EU MDR / AI Act Alignment  

### Tooling & Workflow
- Python, TypeScript, Swift  
- VS Code, GitHub  
- Multi-agent orchestration frameworks  
- Deterministic code-gen pipelines  
- Local RAG systems  
- Frontier models (selective, purpose-bound usage)  

I focus on technologies that provide **engineer-level control**, **audit trails**, and **predictable behavior** — avoiding black-box dependencies whenever possible.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

### 1. **Structure First, Code Second**  
Specs, constraints, and traceability are the foundation of high-trust systems.

### 2. **Local-First for Privacy & Speed**  
Latency, reliability, and sovereignty matter. Everything that can run on-device, should.

### 3. **Deterministic AI > Guesswork AI**  
Tools should behave predictably. Reproducibility is a feature.

### 4. **Agentic Systems Need Governance**  
Agents require context discipline, shared memory, and unified instruction layers.

### 5. **Regulatory Alignment Is a Strategic Moat**  
Compliance isn’t overhead — it’s a differentiator.

## 📂 Public Repositories

Only **non-commercial**, **safe**, and **non-confidential** repositories appear here.  
Active venture projects remain private inside the studio infrastructure.

# 📱 Current Project — Mobile App (Codename: Solstice)

I’m currently designing the architecture and engineering framework for **Solstice**, a new offline-first mobile application focused on structured personal productivity and intelligent note workflows.

The MVP explores:

### **Core Principles**
- 100% **local-first** (no cloud, no analytics, no data egress)  
- Instant interaction with **on-device AI**  
- Privacy as a design constraint  
- Minimalist UX built for cognitive clarity  

### **Early Feature Set (Non-Sensitive)**
- Intelligent note expansion using deterministic, local AI  
- Context-aware organization of study materials and personal notes  
- Distraction-free writing workflow  
- Local semantic search over user data (documents, notes)  
- Zero-latency offline operation in low-connectivity environments  

The project is built with a **privacy-first philosophy** and intentionally excludes medical, diagnostic, or regulated functionality.

More will be shared publicly after the MVP is released.
